      <p class="PARA2">
        It was a quite day, everything was calm. Two ducks, a mother and father 
        duck was brought into shock and joy as one of the eggs started hatching one by one. 5 eggs hatched but one was remaining, 
        the two parent ducks waited paitenly to see there youngest ducklin hatch. After endless hours of waiting the eggs started 
        shaking and it started to hatch. The mama and papa ducks were so happy and filled with joy. 
      </p>

      <p class="PARA2">
        The ducklins, brothers and sisters would go swimming every morning and the mama duck will lead the line of baby ducks along 
        side the papa duck. However one day things took a bad turn, One day as they were swimming they came face to face with a fox. 
        The fox seemed hungry and the fox after seeing the ducks couldn't stop its urge to eat out of hunger.
      </p>

      <p class="PARA2">
        The fox charged at the ducks and attacked. The father duck stood in front to protect his family but fox bit and ate him, he wasn't 
        finished he continued on to the mamma duck and ate her duckilns along with her except one. The surviving duck, the youngest duck 
        stood in front of his family, he moaned and cried out loud but no one was there. No one to help the baby ducklin. The Ducklin knew 
        it wasn't gonna survive alone and has to find a safer place.
      </p>

      <p class="PARA2">
        With tears in the ducklins eyes leaving its mothers, father, brothers and sisters. The ducklin walked over the lands and saw the out streched 
        ocean. The duck knew what the duck stood before, and the duck steps into the water and swims through the paciffic through the countinets 
        through rivers and through tough weather.
      </p>

      <p class="PARA2">
        After days and months of swimming the duck finds a nice island. With a new mind the duck steps onto the land, clueless of where the duck is 
        the duck seems lost. The duck wonders around the island to meet to hopeless donkey. The donkey looked tired and hopeless, the duck 
        asked the donkey "Do you know where we are?" The donkey got shocked to see a duck "OH MY ! your a duck, what are you doing here?" the donkey 
        replies and the duck answers "I swam here and right now i'm lost on this strange island" the donkey understood the duck and told the duck that 
        this island is where humans are building a huge zoo. Suddenly as they were speaking, A huge truck came at full speed towards them both, the duck 
        and the donkey started to running for there light however they fell into a mud pit and got stuck and over them the truck got stuck in the mud as well. 
        The duck and donkey were stuck under the truck. The donkey lost all hopes but the duck didn't give up easily. The duck had an idea and the duck 
        climbed on the donkey and the donkey climbed on the truck. Duck donkey truck. The duck was to become a hero in the island and they lived 
        happily ever after . TO BE CONTINUED.....
